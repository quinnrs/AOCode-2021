Hi! I'm Eric Wastl. I make Advent of Code. I hope you like it! I also made Vanilla JS, PHP Sadness, and lots of other things. 
You can find me on Twitter and GitHub.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that 
can be solved in any programming language you like. 

Advent of Code Challenge scenario

Before you know it, you're inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for situations like this. 
It's covered in Christmas lights (because of course it is), and it even has an experimental antenna 
that should be able to track the keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough;

Increase signal strengthby solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; 
the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. 
Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

day 1 - data analysis & trending
day 2 - 2D vertors and steps
day 3 - binary data analysis
